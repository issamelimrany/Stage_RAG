"[[""What were the key events and influences in Einstein's early education?"", ""Einstein's early education was not traditionally structured. He struggled with the rote learning methods in primary school but excelled in mathematics and physics from a young age. His teacher, Max Talmud, recognized his potential and encouraged him to think creatively. At age 15, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (now ETH Zurich) without having completed secondary education. This unconventional path set the foundation for Einstein's groundbreaking work in physics.""]]",,,2024-07-31 20:23:07.133370
