"[[""What were the key events and influences in Einstein's early education?"", ""Einstein's early education took place in Munich and Zurich, where he demonstrated exceptional intellect. He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich but did not feel academically challenged, leading to his transfer to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (later ETH Zurich) in 1896. It was here that Einstein's scientific journey began, and he developed his theories on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and general theory of relativity, which revolutionized physics. These groundbreaking contributions were made during Einstein's \""Annus Mirabilis\"" in 1905, following his education.""]]",,,2024-08-01 15:09:11.124896
