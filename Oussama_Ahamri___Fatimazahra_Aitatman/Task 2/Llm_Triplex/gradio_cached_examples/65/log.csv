"[[""What were the key events and influences in Einstein's early education?"", ""Einstein's early education was marked by self-study and exploration, as he showed an exceptional talent for mathematics and physics at a young age. He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich but found the teaching methods restrictive. Later, he moved to Switzerland where he studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, earning his diploma in 1900. During this time, Einstein's groundbreaking work began with the \""Annus Mirabilis\"" of 1905, when he published four papers that revolutionized physics, including the paper on the photoelectric effect for which he later received the Nobel Prize.""]]",,,2024-08-01 13:23:05.372315
