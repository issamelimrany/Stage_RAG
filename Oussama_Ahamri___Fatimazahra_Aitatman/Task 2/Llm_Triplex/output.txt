Isaac Newton, born on December 25, 1642 (according to the Julian calendar then in use in England) in 
Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, and died on March 20, 1727, in London, is one of the most influential scientists in 
history. His major contributions to physics,  mathematics, and astronomy laid the foundations of modern science 
and profoundly transformed our understanding of the natural world.  
Childhood and Education  
Isaac Newton was born prematurely into a family of farmers. His father, also named Isaac Newton, d ied three 
months before his birth, and his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, remarried when Isaac was three years old, 
leaving him in the care of his grandmother. A solitary child, Newton showed an insatiable curiosity about the 
world around him from a young  age. 
He began his schooling at the village school in Grantham, where he showed exceptional talent for mathematics. 
At 18, he entered Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he was deeply influenced by the works 
of philosophers and scientists  like René Descartes, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler.  
Plague Years and Discoveries  
In 1665, an outbreak of the plague forced the University of Cambridge to close, and Newton returned to 
Woolsthorpe for two years. These years, often called the "miracu lous years," were among the most productive 
of his life. During this period, Newton made revolutionary discoveries in mathematics, optics, and gravitation.  
He developed calculus independently but simultaneously with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm 
Leibniz, leading to a controversy over the authorship of this discovery. Newton also conducted experiments on 
light and colors, demonstrating that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, which led to his major 
work on optics, "Opticks" (1704).  
Prin cipia Mathematica  
Newton's most famous contribution is undoubtedly his work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" 
(1687), often abbreviated as "Principia." In this book, Newton states the three laws of motion that became the 
basis of classical mech anics:  
1. The law of inertia: A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues to move at a constant velocity 
in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.  
2. The fundamental law of dynamics: The acc eleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and 
inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma).  
3. The law of action and reaction: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
In "Principia," Newton also formulates the law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle of 
matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their 
masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This  law explained not only the 
movements of planets and celestial objects but also terrestrial phenomena like the fall of bodies.  
Contributions to Optics  
In addition to his work in mechanics and gravitation, Newton made significant contributions to optics. He  
showed that white light is composed of all the colors of the visible spectrum, which he discovered using a prism 
to decompose sunlight. These experiments refuted the dominant idea of the time that white light was pure and 
simple.  
His work "Opticks" explor es the nature of light and color, as well as the refraction, reflection, and dispersion of 
light. Newton also invented the reflecting telescope, or Newtonian telescope, which uses a concave mirror 
instead of lenses to reduce chromatic aberrations and impro ve image quality.  
Later Years and Legacy  
In 1696, Newton was appointed Warden of the Royal Mint, and three years later, he became Master of the Mint. 
In this role, he oversaw a major monetary reform and fought against counterfeiting, sometimes using very 
rigorous means to pursue forgers.  
Newton also became president of the Royal Society in 1703, a position he held until his death. He was knighted 
by Queen Anne in 1705, becoming Sir Isaac Newton.  
Newton spent his later years in London, where he continued to work on his research and correspond with other 
scientists. He died on March 20, 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, a rare honor for a scientist.  
Newton's legacy is immense. His laws of motion and law of universal gravitation dominated the scientifi c view 
of the physical world until the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. His work in optics laid the 
foundations for the physics of colors and the wave theory of light. In mathematics, calculus became a 
fundamental tool for many scientific and engineering disciplines.  
Isaac Newton not only transformed our understanding of the universe but also established a rigorous scientific 
method that continues to guide scientific research today.  
 
Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in Germany, and died on 
April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, is one of the most influential and renowned theoretical 
physicists in history. His work revolutionized our understanding of phys ics, particularly with the theory of 
relativity, and profoundly influenced science and philosophy in the 20th century.  
Childhood and Education  
Einstein was born into a non -practicing Jewish family. His father, Hermann Einstein, was a salesman and 
engineer,  and his mother, Pauline Koch, was an accomplished musician. From a young age, Einstein showed 
exceptional curiosity and talent for mathematics and physics.  
In 1889, the Einstein family moved to Munich, where Albert attended the Luitpold Gymnasium. However , he 
was unhappy at school, where he often felt stifled by the strict and rigid teaching. In 1894, the family moved 
again, this time to Pavia, Italy, but Einstein stayed in Germany to finish his studies. In 1895, he left school 
without a diploma and joined  his parents in Italy.  
Formative Years and Early Work  
In 1896, Einstein entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (ETH Zurich) after passing an entrance exam. 
There, he focused on physics and mathematics. It was at the ETH that he met his future wife, Mileva Marić, a 
fellow physics student.  
After graduatin g in 1900, Einstein struggled to find an academic position and accepted a job at the Patent Office 
in Bern, Switzerland, in 1902. This job gave him the time to develop his own scientific ideas. In his spare time, 
he worked on theories that would revolution ize physics.  
Annus Mirabilis (Miraculous Year) of 1905  
The year 1905, often called the "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miraculous Year," was an extraordinary year for Einstein. 
He published four groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal "Annalen der Physik," e ach having a major 
impact on physics:  
1. Photoelectric Effect: In this paper, Einstein proposed that light is composed of quanta (later called photons) and 
explained the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. This work  was 
crucial for the development of quantum mechanics.  
2. Brownian Motion: He explained the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, providing experimental 
evidence for atomic theory.  
3. Special Relativity: This paper introduced the theory of special rel ativity, demonstrating that the laws of physics 
are the same for all observers in uniform motion and that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames.  
4. E=mc²: In this paper, Einstein established the equivalence of mass and energy, expressed by the  famous 
equation E=mc², indicating that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.  
General Theory of Relativity  
In 1915, after years of intense work, Einstein presented his general theory of relativity to the Prussian Academy 
of Sciences. This theor y extended special relativity to include gravitation as a curvature of space -time caused by 
mass. The theory was confirmed in 1919 when observations of a solar eclipse showed the deflection of starlight 
by the Sun's gravitational field, as predicted by the  theory.  
Years of Fame and Social Activities  
Einstein quickly became a worldwide celebrity. He held academic positions in Switzerland, Germany, and the 
United States. In 1933, due to the rise of Nazism in Germany, Einstein left his position at the Universi ty of 
Berlin and emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in 
Princeton.  
Einstein was also a fervent advocate for peace and civil rights. He used his fame to speak out against militarism, 
nationalism, and racial discrimination. He was a committed pacifist, although he supported the development of 
the atomic bomb during World War II out of fear that Nazi Germany would develop it first.  
Later Years and Legacy  
Einstein spent his later years in Princeton, w here he continued to work on a unified field theory, an attempt to 
reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics. Although this unified theory was not realized in his 
lifetime, his efforts inspired much subsequent research.  
He died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76. His legacy endures through his numerous contributions to science 
and society. The theory of relativity transformed our understanding of the universe, influencing not only physics 
but also philosophy, cosmology, and engineering sciences. H is work on the photoelectric effect was essential to 
the development of quantum mechanics, and his equation E=mc² remains one of the most famous and 
significant formulas in physics.  
Einstein is also known for his profound thoughts on the nature of reality,  knowledge, and creativity. He left 
behind a rich collection of scientific and philosophical writings that continue to inspire researchers and thinkers 
worldwide.
